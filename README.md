# SWE-Project
Application that allows students to book carpooling trips between university campuses in Florence, developed for the Software Engineering exame.

This project aims to develop an application for managing and using university carsharing services: the university provides shuttles that students can use to travel between university campuses efficiently and sustainably. The application will be used by students to book trips as passengers or drivers, and by administrators to manage resources. The system must allow students or administrators to register and authenticate themselves to the application, and to book and view trips. The project draws inspiration from TUSS (The Ultimate Sharing Service) at the University of Florence, a service developed to offer a concrete solution to the difficulties of traveling between different university campuses.
